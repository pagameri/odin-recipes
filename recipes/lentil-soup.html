                <ol>
                    <li>Sauté the veggies. Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.
                        Add onion and carrots and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally,
                        until the onions are soft and translucent.  Add garlic and sauté for 1
                        more minute, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Simmer. Stir in the vegetable stock, lentils, corn, cumin, curry powder
                        (plus saffron and cayenne, if using) until combined.  Continue cooking until
                        the soup reaches a simmer.  Then cover and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally,
                        until the lentils are completely tender.</li>
                    <li>Blend (optional). Using either a hand blender or traditional blender,
                        puree the soup until it reaches your desired consistency.
                        (If using a traditional blender, please see notes below.)</li>
                    <li>Season. Stir in the lemon zest and juice until combined.
                        Taste and season the soup with a generous pinch or two of fine sea salt and black pepper, as needed.</li>
                    <li>Serve. Serve warm, garnished with an extra fresh lemon slice if desired.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Slow cook. Add onion, carrots, garlic, vegetable stock, lentils, corn, cumin, curry powder
                        (plus saffron and cayenne, if using) to the bowl of a large slow cooker, and stir to combine.
                        (No olive oil needed.) Cover and cook on high for 2-3 hours, or on low for 5-6 hours,
                        until the lentils are completely tender.</li>
                    <li>Blend. Using either a hand blender or traditional blender, puree the soup until it reaches
                        your desired consistency.  (If using a traditional blender, please see notes below.)</li>
                    <li>Season. Stir in the lemon zest and juice until combined.
