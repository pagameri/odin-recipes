		<h1>Tiramisù</h1>
		<img src="../img/tiramisu.jpg">
		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This Italian tiramisù recipe is easy to whip up, this version is made with cooked
				(instead of raw) eggs, and it tastes just as indulgent and delicious as ever.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>8 large egg yolks</li>
					<li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
					<li>1/2 cup dry marsala*, divided</li>
					<li>1 pound (16 ounces) mascarpone cheese</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
					<li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
					<li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
					<li>1 1/2 cups espresso (or very strong coffee*)</li>
					<li>36 to 42 crisp Italian ladyfingers (one 14-ounce package*)</li>
					<li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
				</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Make the zabaglione.</strong> Heat 1 inch of water in a large saucepan over medium heat until
					simmering. Combine the egg yolks, sugar and 1/4 cup of the dry marsala in a metal
					(or heat-proof glass) mixing bowl, and set it atop the saucepan. Using a whisk (or a
					hand mixer on low speed), whisk the mixture constantly for 5 to 7 minutes until it has
					turned a pale yellow color and nearly tripled in volume. Remove from heat and transfer
					the mixture to the refrigerator briefly to cool while you continue on with Steps 2 and 3.</li>
				<li><strong>Whisk the mascarpone mixture.</strong> Combine the mascarpone, vanilla extract and sea salt in a
					large mixing bowl. Use a hand mixer (or a stand mixer) to beat the mixture on medium
					speed for 1 minute or until smooth. Transfer mascarpone mixture to a clean bowl and set aside.</li>
				<li><strong>Whip the cream.</strong> Add the heavy cream to the same large mixing bowl and beat using a handheld
					mixer (or stand mixer) on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
				<li><strong>Combine the filling.</strong> Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the
					whipped cream until it is mostly combined. Then gradually fold in the zabaglione mixture
					until combined.  Set aside.</li>
				<li><strong>Make the espresso mixture.</strong> Stir together the espresso and remaining 1/4 cup
					of marsala in a small bowl.</li>
				<li><strong>Assemble the tiramisu.</strong> One at a time, dip the ladyfingers (very quickly!) into
					the espresso so that both sides are coated, then arrange the lady fingers in an even layer
					covering the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish. Once the layer is complete, use a spoon
					(or an offset spatula) to spread half of the creamy filling mixture evenly on top of the
					ladyfingers. Repeat with a second layer of the espresso-dipped ladyfingers,
					followed by a second layer of the creamy filling.</li>
				<li><strong>Chill.</strong> Cover and refrigerate the tiramisù for at least 4 to 6 hours, or until chilled.</li>
				<li><strong>Serve.</strong> Use a fine-mesh strainer to dust the top of the tiramisù evenly with a layer of 
					cocoa powder. Then slice, serve and enjoy! Leftovers can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.</li>
