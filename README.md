# odin-recipes
First TOP project

The task was the create a webpage containing 3 recipes.
While doing so:
 - a boilerplate was generated multiple times, getting some extra practice,
 - needed to use relative links to open the separate pages for each recipe,
 - had to link in images
 - gave title and different headings to the page
 - used ordered and unordered lists
 - given importance to certain words throughout the project
 - changed the tab to 2 spaces vs the pre defined 4 throughout the pages

 Once the pages were populated it was time to add styles to it:
  - kept it very basic, set font and colour
  - googled how to position image to the right side (used float)

//  write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
